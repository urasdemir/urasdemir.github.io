## Courses Designed and Taught
### Empirical Methods (Political Science Quantitative Methods)
How can we use data to explain political phenomena?
This course introduces students to the logic and practice of quantitative research with R in political science, covering:
- Foundations of theory-building and research design
- Data collection, measurement, and visualization
- Descriptive and inferential statistics
- Bivariate relationships and simple regression analysis
Students gain hands-on experience with statistical software (R) and learn how to critically evaluate empirical findings in political science research.

### Advanced Empirical Methods (Political Science Quantitative Methods II)
How do we move from simple relationships to robust causal analysis?
This course builds on Empirical Methods, delving deeper into advanced quantitative tools used in contemporary political science research, including:
- Advanced regression designs
- Model diagnostics, robustness checks, and data visualization
- Survey design and experimental methods
Students design and analyze their own research projects, learning how to connect theoretical questions with rigorous empirical evidence.

### International Security
Why do wars occur, and how can peace be sustained?
This course explores the causes and consequences of conflict and cooperation among states and nonstate actors, focusing on:
- Theories of war, deterrence, and alliance politics
- Dimensions of security
- Contemporary issues such as nuclear proliferation, economic security, and climate security
Students analyze historical and contemporary cases through major theoretical perspectives, linking abstract concepts to real-world security challenges.

### International Organization
How do international institutions shape global cooperation and conflict?
This course examines the design, evolution, and impact of international organizations and regimes across key issue areas, including:
- Theoretical foundations of institutionalism and global governance
- The United Nations, WTO, IMF, NATO, and regional organizations
- Compliance, enforcement, and legitimacy in international law
- Global challenges: trade disputes, human rights, climate change, and security
Students learn how formal and informal institutions structure state behavior, promote cooperation, and sometimes fail to prevent conflict.

### Computational Political Analysis
How do computational political scientists carry out research?  
This R-integrated course introduces students to the fundamentals of computational political science. Topics include:

- Research design
- Data collection
- Data wrangling with tidyverse
- Data visualization with ggplot2
- Application of basic quantitative methods

While primarily designed for political science majors, the practical and transferable research skills taught in this course are applicable across all social sciences ‚Äî and beyond.

### Introduction to International Relations
What are the causes of change in the international system?  
This course explores how states and nonstate actors interact with each other, examining:

- Overview of international relations history
- Key theories, concepts, and debates
- Contemporary global issues (trade and finance, human rights, climate change)

This course provides a strong foundation for further studies in international relations.
